                <p>We have hundreds of restaurants to choose from. When you open the app, you can scroll through for inspiration or search for a particular restaurant or cuisine. When you find something you like, tap to add it to your order</p>

                <h3>Order</h3>
                <p>When you’re ready to check out, you’ll see your address, an estimated delivery time, and the price of the order including tax and delivery fee. When everything looks right, just tap Place order—and that’s it.</p>

                <h3>Track</h3>
                <p>Follow your order in the app. First you’ll see the restaurant accept and start prepping. Then, when the order’s almost ready, a nearby delivery person—in a car, on a bike, or on a scooter—will go to the restaurant to pick it up. Next, they’ll drive or ride to you. You’ll be able to see their name and photo and track their progress on the map.</p>
